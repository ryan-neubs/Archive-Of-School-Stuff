# Archive-Of-School-Stuff
# Wanted to create a space to store all projects/assignments I've done as a CS student. Decided to move it all to my GitHub.
# For those who are visiting, feel free to take the code and do whatever with it. The main language we used was Python. I did a case study type thing on Java so there is # a little hint of that in there. We also had a few projects in Racket (which I really do not understand).
#
# Each directory is for each class I've taken, I'll include the actual names of the classes below:
