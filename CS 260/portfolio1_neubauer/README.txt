Current Directory: Image
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Required project: image.py
Description: Tool for viewing and creating ppm images
by: Ryan Neubauer
status: Complete and 'mostly' working. Basic functions work but there is
some sort of issue when using tictactoe.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Required Project: invert.py
Description: Inverts all the colors of an image
by: Ryan Neubauer
status: Complete and working (see inverted.ppm)
usage: python planets-left.ppm inverted.ppm
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Required Project: grayscale.py
Description: Attempts to grayscale an image
by: Ryan Neubauer
status: Doesn't work, created some sort of green filter on accident. Couldn't
figure out the grayscale modification but I guess I now have some cool green filter!
usage: python planets-left.ppm gray.ppm
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current Directory: Painter
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Required Project: painter.py
Description: Painter tool for drawing ppm images
by: Ryan Neubauer
status: Works great - all tools and tests function properly
usage: When running painter.py the test drawings will show. The program will guide
you to press enter to show you my two custom drawings. First drawing draws a series
of circles stacked with random colors, the second is a circle that has a smooth
gradient from the outside in.

Required Project: matrix.py
Description: A tool for matrix operations
by: Ryan Neubauer
status: Works great - had fun testing all my list comprehension chops
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Required Project: trans2d.py
Description: A tool for various transformations when drawing images
by: Ryan Neubauer
status: Working great
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Required Project: render2d.py
Description: A tool for rendering 2d images
by: Ryan Neubauer
status: Looks to work just fine - tictactoe test does not work but this is due
to something with image.py that I couldn't quite figure out
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Required Project: tictactoe.py
Description: A tool for rendering 2d images
by: Ryan Neubauer
status: Partial functionality - not only do images look quite choppy but there is
some sort of error that comes up near the end of the drawing in image.py. Brice 
tried to help me fix it but his fix did not work unfortunately. That being said
without a proper tictactoe, I couldn't complete the tictactoe board.
